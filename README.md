# Python GDSII Pattern Generation for Klayout 

A set of Python scripts for generating GDSII files in Klayout. 

## Features
The scripts each generate differing periodic patterns. Arrays of one- and two-dimensional guided mode resonance gratings are produced, as well as long gratings for investigating a facet of an etch. Additionally, code is included for creating 1- and 2-D chirped guided mode resonance gratings.

## Requirements and installation
These scripts were created and tested with Python 3.11 and Klayout 0.28.8; use with earlier versions of Python is at your own risk.
